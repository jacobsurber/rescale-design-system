# Testing Node-Specific Extraction

## Current Test Results

### Approach 1: Node ID Targeting
- ❌ **Node ID 705-19295**: "No node could not be found"
- ❌ **Node ID 705:19295**: "No node could not be found"
- ❌ **Empty nodeId**: Returns full component (not individual icons)

### Issues Identified:
1. **Unknown Node IDs**: We don't know the actual node IDs for individual icons
2. **Selection Context**: The MCP server may only see what's currently selected in Figma desktop
3. **Node Structure**: We need to understand the component hierarchy

## Next Steps to Try

### Method 1: Manual Selection Workflow
**Instructions for User:**
1. Open Figma desktop with the sidebar component
2. **Select ONLY the "Jobs" icon** (the folder icon next to "Jobs")
3. Make sure only that icon is selected, not the whole menu item
4. Let me run the extraction again

### Method 2: Get Node Structure Information
Try to extract the component hierarchy to find individual node IDs:
- Get the full component code (with truncation)
- Look for node references in the generated code
- Identify individual icon node IDs

### Method 3: Assets Endpoint Testing
Test if the MCP server exposes an assets endpoint:
- Check localhost:3845/assets/ 
- Look for individual SVG files
- Test direct asset access

## Questions for User:

1. **Can you select just one icon** (like the Jobs folder icon) in Figma desktop?
2. **Is the Figma desktop app showing the MCP server as active** (usually shows in preferences)?
3. **Which specific icon would you like me to try extracting first?**

## Expected Behavior:
If node targeting works correctly, selecting just an icon should return only that icon image, not the full component.
