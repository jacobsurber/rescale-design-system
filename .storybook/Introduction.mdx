# Rescale Design System

Welcome to the **Rescale Design System** ‚Äì a comprehensive component library and design language built specifically for computational engineering and scientific computing applications.

## üéØ Purpose

This design system provides a consistent, accessible, and scalable foundation for building user interfaces across the Rescale platform. It embodies our commitment to:

- **Consistency**: Unified visual language and interaction patterns
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant components for all users
- **Performance**: Optimized components built with modern React patterns
- **Developer Experience**: Well-documented, type-safe, and easy to use

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Our design system follows **Atomic Design** principles, organizing components into five distinct levels:

### Atoms
Basic building blocks that cannot be broken down further:
- **Button** - Interactive elements with comprehensive variants
- **Icon** - Standardized iconography with theme support
- **Logo** - Brand and software logo components
- **StatusTag** - Status indicators with semantic colors
- **LoadingSpinner** - Animated loading states

### Molecules
Simple combinations of atoms functioning together:
- **Card** - Flexible containers with elevation and sizing
- **FormInput** - Labeled input fields with validation
- **MetricCard** - Data visualization with trends and progress
- **PageHeader** - Page titles with breadcrumbs and actions

### Organisms
Complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms:
- **JobsTable** - Feature-rich data tables with sorting and filtering
- **Sidebar** - Navigation menus with user profiles
- **SoftwareLogoGrid** - Grid displays for software packages

### Templates
Page-level layouts combining organisms and molecules:
- **DashboardLayout** - Complete application shell with sidebar and header
- **JobsListPage** - Full-featured job listing with filters and pagination
- **JobDetailsPage** - Comprehensive job management interface

## üé® Design Tokens

Our design system is built on a comprehensive token system extracted from Figma designs:

- **Colors**: Brand colors, semantic colors, and interaction states
- **Typography**: Consistent type scales and font weights
- **Spacing**: 4px-based spacing system for consistent layouts
- **Shadows**: Elevation system for depth and hierarchy
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install @rescale/design-system
```

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { Button, Card, DashboardLayout } from '@rescale/design-system';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <DashboardLayout
      menuItems={menuItems}
      userProfile={userProfile}
    >
      <Card title="Welcome">
        <p>Get started building with Rescale components!</p>
        <Button variant="primary">
          Start Building
        </Button>
      </Card>
    </DashboardLayout>
  );
}
```

### TypeScript Support

All components include comprehensive TypeScript definitions:

```tsx
import type { ButtonProps, CardProps } from '@rescale/design-system';

// Full type safety and IntelliSense support
const MyButton: React.FC<ButtonProps> = (props) => {
  return <Button {...props} />;
};
```

## üì± Responsive Design

Every component is designed with mobile-first principles:

- **Breakpoints**: Consistent breakpoint system across all components
- **Flexible Layouts**: Components adapt to different screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly**: Appropriate touch targets for mobile devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhanced experiences on larger screens

## ‚ôø Accessibility

Accessibility is built into every component:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
